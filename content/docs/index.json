                        "Plenti is an open source Static Site Generator (SSG).",
                        "The templates are based on Svelte, which is a JavaScript library for building reactive user interfaces.",
                        "Because Svelte is compiled, your app stays very light and performs well, even on underpowered devices.",
                        "You might also notice that Plenti runs significantly faster than other JavaScript SSGs you may have tried.",
                        "This is because the commandline interface (CLI) is built using Go and we've cut out slow processes like traditional bundlers.",
                        "Our goal is to keep the tooling to a minimum so it's easy to install and use."

                        "It's hard to argue why the world needs another SSG given the variety that already exists today, but let us try.",
                        "Most solutions have optimized for either the build process, or the display of the website.",
                        "That's why you see so many SSGs claiming to be the fastest - they are all talking about different things.",
                        "We think the missing piece that will open up the JAMstack to the masses is an integrated, Git-backed CMS.",
                        "In order to take advantage of this, we needed both a fast build and a reactive frontend that can connect to a Git repository.",
                        "That's why we're obsessing over speed (we're actively trying to make the builds even faster).",
                        "We also use a simple JSON data source instead of Markdown, because we don't intend for you to edit content directly through files.",
                        "We expect this will be done completely through the website user interface. It should also require minimum setup.",
                        "There are no shortage of excellent headless CMS options on the market for JAMstack, but most require purchasing a license for",
                        "a proprietary product, take significant developer time to connect to your website, lack on features like live displays,",
                        "and there is often duplicate work to match your data source structure with the CMS fields."
