Types are just a way to group content of a similar structure. Individual files inside a type are very flexible, in fact you can define any field schema you'd like and there are no required keys. Even though files may be grouped together as a type, they can actually have variability between them in terms of their field structure - just make sure you account for this in your corresponding <code>layouts/content/</code> files!<div><h2>Accessing content in layouts</h2>Any user defined fields in your json files are accessed by the <code>content.fields</code> prop in your layouts. The top level content prop has the following defined keys that are available for all content sources:<ul><li><code>content.pager</code></li><li><code>content.type</code></li><li><code>content.path</code></li><li><code>content.filepath</code></li><li><code>content.filename</code></li><li><code>content.fields</code></li></ul><h2>Single file types</h2>Anything that appears at the first level within the content folder is a type. This can include single files such as <code>index.json</code> and <code>404.json</code>, which are also types, but only have a one-off data source. You can define your own single file types this way if you'd like. You can also generate a single type using the CLI: <code>plenti new type YOUR_TYPE --single=true</code></div><div><h2>Defaults</h2>There is an optional, specially named file that goes inside your individual type folders named <code>_defaults.json</code>. This defines the default content for that specific type. The Plenti Git-CMS uses this to create new content of a particular type. If you have a type that you don't want editors to be able to add new instances of,&nbsp; simply omit the <code>_defaults.json</code> file. Note that <code>--single</code> content is not meant to be repeated and does not have a corresponding blueprint file.</div><div><h2>Schema</h2></div><div>There is anther optional, specially named file that goes inside your individual type folders named&nbsp;<code>_schema.json</code>. This can be used to override the field widgets of the content editor. If you want to override the widgets being used by&nbsp;<span style=\"color: var(--base-dark);\">a</span><span style=\"color: var(--base-dark);\">&nbsp;</span><code>--single</code><span style=\"color: var(--base-dark);\">&nbsp;type, simply prefix \"_schema\" to the front of the file (for example</span><span style=\"color: var(--base-dark);\">&nbsp;</span><code>_schema_index.json</code><span style=\"color: var(--base-dark);\">&nbsp;).</span></div>"
