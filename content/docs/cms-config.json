	"body": "The Plenti CMS is designed to work out-of-the box with zero configuration. It's a \"Discoverable CMS\" that reads your content source and provides a default editing experience that you can use locally or deploy to a remote site and use Continuous Integration (CI) to manage updates. You can define defaults, schemas, and components to progressively enhance your editing experience if you so choose.<div><h2>Creating new content</h2></div><div>If you want to be able to create new content through the CMS, you need to define a <code>_defaults.json</code> within your content type (e.g. <code>content/pages/_defaults.json</code>). The CMS will pick up on this and provide a new option in the admin interface under \"Add\" in the top navbar. The widgets provided will be based on the types of content you use for your default scaffolding, however you can override these by also defining a <code>_schema.json</code> file for your content type (e.g. <code>content/pages/_schema.json</code>).</div><div><h2>Creating new component content</h2></div><div>Component defaults are defined in a similar manner to content type defaults, however they <i>must</i>&nbsp;go in a special named folded called <code>_components</code> inside your top level content folder&nbsp;(e.g. <code>content/_components/grid/_defaults.json</code>). Components do not get their own pages/endpoints, they only exist within the context of being placed on a particular page. In order to do this, you need a content type with a <code>_schema.json</code> file that specifies a component widget for one of its fields:</div><div><br></div><codeblock>{<br>&nbsp; \"myfield\": {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; \"type\": \"component\",<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; \"options\": [<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \"hero\",<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \"grid\",<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \"slider\"<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; ]<br>&nbsp; }<br>}</codeblock>"
